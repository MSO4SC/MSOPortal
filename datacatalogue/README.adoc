= Data Catalogue docker image

Brings the MSO4SC catalogue through _docker-compose_, based on CKAN: https://github.com/ckan/ckan

== How to run

.*Requires*
* docker >= 18, docker-compose >= 1.16, local persist driver
* A working IDM instance
* A working portal instance to which the data catalogue will redirect after log in

* Copy _template.env_ to _.env_, and edit the created file with your configuration.

=== Persistence
Data persistence is ensured by the named volumes created with docker compose. However, after container creation, the search index need to be rebuilt. Use the `rebuild-search-index.sh` script for that.

* Run `docker-compose up -d`
* Access to the data catalogue through a web browser.
