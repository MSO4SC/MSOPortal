= Marketplace docker image

Brings the MSO4SC marketplace through _docker-compose_, based on Fiware Business API Ecosystem: https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/Business-API-Ecosystem

== How to run

.Requires
* docker >= 18, docker-compose >= 1.16
* A working IDM instance
* A working portal instance to which the marketplace will redirect after log in

.Configuration
* Copy _template.env_ to _.env_, and edit the created file with your configuration.
* Set the same mysql password in variable  `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` defined in the preivious step, in the file `conf/rss/database.properties`
* Set the host of the marketplace in `conf/apis/settings.properties`

NOTE: `CONFIG_PATH` references to _conf_ folder, and `DATA_PATH` to where application data will be stored. `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` is the root password that mysql will use.

Finally *run* `docker-compose up -d`. After a few minutes, access to the marketplace through the port 8004 in a web browser.
