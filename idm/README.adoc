== How to run

*Requires* docker >= 18 and docker-compose >= 1.16

* Copy _template.env_ to _.env_, and edit the created file with your configuration.
* If set IDM_HTTPS=true, run `./generate_certs.sh` to generate the https certs (the script assume Ubuntu 16.04, modify to other distributions).

NOTE: `IDM_CONFIG` is the path to the config.js file. `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` is the root password that mysql will use, and `MYSQL_DATA` is the path to where mysql files are/will be stored.

* Run `docker-compose up -d`
* Access to the IDM through the 3000 port in a web browser (for https use 443 and https protocol). Default admin user _admin@test.com_, password _1234_.
